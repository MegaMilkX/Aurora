<h1>Aurora (multipurpose c++ library) documentation</h1>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Often times when you want to write a small graphical application like a simple game there is a huge hurdle in the way.
Even if you worked with graphical APIs before, configuring various vertex buffers, resource loading and other stuff can be a tad cumbersome.
On the other hand using existing "engines" can introduce a large baggage of dependencies and constructs that you might not necessarily need in your project.
That's why I decided to create this library.</p>
<p>Aurora is a collection of many separate classes that each serve their own purpose (much like boost) like window creation, input handling, graphics and other useful stuff.</p>
<h3>Setting up</h3>
<p>At the moment aurora is supposed to be built into one static library. This of course is undesirable, since it's unlikely you will be using all of it in one project.
But while the library is small and undeveloped this is the way to go, for simplicity.</p>
<p>[TODO: Add how-to-build info]</p>
